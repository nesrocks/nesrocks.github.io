Old = original game, New = rebalanced hp for enemies. Set “new” as default.<br>- Made it so enemies don’t have invincibility frames when attacked when using the “new” fighting setting.<br>- The special attack does 50% more damage in the “new” fighting setting.<br>- Redesigned the options screen.<br>- Moved the “nesrocks.com 2021″ credit into the options screen.<br>- Difficulty settings now also affect the enemies’ aggressiveness.<br>- Difficulty settings now also affect enemies’ starting hp if using “new” fighting mode.<br>- Improved how scrolling works. Standing on the right side of the screen causes an auto scroll to take place. The point at which a manual scroll happens has been moved slightly to the left for a better experience. So now the screen is divided into 3 areas, as far as scrolling is concerned, instead of the original 2. No scroll, manual scroll and auto scroll. Originally it was just no scroll and manual scroll.<br>- Added compatibility to the “TMNT II - The Arcade Game Revamped” and to the “TMNT2 - Bugfix &amp; Polish” hacks. First apply the revamped patch, then the bugfix patch, and then the options mode patch.<br>Changed the \"ULTRA\" word for \"KONAMI\" one in the credits sequence.</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">Version 1.0</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><!-- wp:image {\"id\":984,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figure class=\"wp-image-984\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://nesrocks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-II-Options-Menu-0-1.png\" alt=\"\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><!-- /wp:image --> <!-- wp:image {\"id\":985,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figure class=\"wp-image-985\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://nesrocks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-II-Options-Menu-1.png\" alt=\"\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><!-- /wp:image --></p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">Version 1.0:<br>- Title screen and options menus can be controlled with the original select button, but also with Up/Down.<br>- Title screen and options menus can be confirmed with the original start button but also the A button.<br>- Options mode with sound test for all the music in the game.<br>- Options mode for selecting number of lives (0-9).<br>- Options mode for selecting number of continues (0-9).<br>- Options mode for selecting the difficulty mode.<br>Normal = original game.
